For extracting **every** graph from **any** [Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Report](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) (182) into
comma separated value (CSV) files. This code is developed at _speed_ on the COVID-19 Community Mobility Report PDF documents published on Friday 3rd of April 2020.

## Updates

**10/04/2020**: PDF and SVGs updated for the Friday 10th of April 2020 release of data.
**16/04/2020**: PDF and SVGs updated for the Wednesday 15th of April 2020 release of data.

## Installation

We provide the python `requirements.txt` file as well as a `poetry` setup for
dependency management.

We recommend using a virtual environment before installing dependencies.

To install with `pip`:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install with `poetry`

```shell
poetry install
```

### External Dependencies

This project uses `Rtree` which in turn depends on `spatialindex`.

On OSX this can require separate installation:
`brew install spatialindex`

## Usage

**TLDR:**

```shell
# Check what report dates are available
python ./mobius.py dt

# Check if a country is available, with an option to select a date (not specifying a date will show all results)
python ./mobius.py ls <DATE>

# Download PDF and SVG
python ./mobius.py download <COUNTRY_CODE> <DATE>

# Process the PDF and SVG
python ./mobius.py summary <INPUT_PDF> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> <DATES_FILE>
python ./mobius.py full <INPUT_PDF> <INPUT_SVG> <OUTPUT_FOLDER> <DATES_FILE>

```

**Note:** `DATE_FILE` refers to the look up file in the config directory named `dates_lookup_xxxx_xx_xx.csv` where the `x` mark the release date of the reports you are extracting the data from. 

### Full command list

```text
Usage: mobius.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Downloader and processor for Google mobility reports

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  download  Download pdf and svg for a given country using the country code
  dt        List all the dates reports are available for
  full      Produce full CSV of trend data from PDF/SVG input
  pdf       List all the PDFs available in the buckets
  proc      Process a given country SVG
  summary   Produce summary CSV of regional headline figures from CSV

1. **Check what dates reports are available for using  `mobius.py dt` command**:

    ```text
    Usage: mobius.py dt
    
      List the dates reports are available for
    
    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.
    ```

2. **Check for, and download, SVG and PDF files using `mobius.py svg` and `mobius.py download` commands**:

   Use the `mobius.py` command line tool to list all the available countries
   for PDF/SVG and then download them with the two helpful commands below.

    ```text
    Usage: mobius.py svg [OPTIONS][DATE]
    
      List the SVGs available in the buckets for the given date. If no date given, a list of all available SVGs is returned
    
    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.
      <DATE> Lists all the SVGs published on the date
    
    
    Usage: mobius.py pdf [OPTIONS] [DATE]
    
      List the PDFs available in the buckets for the given date. If no date given, a list of all available PDFs is returned
    
    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.
    
    
    Usage: mobius.py download [OPTIONS] COUNTRY_CODE [DATE]
    
      Download PDF and SVG for a given country using the country code and date. If no DATE argument given all available PDFs and SBGs for the given country will be downloaded
    
    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.
    ```

3. **Run the `mobius.py summary` command**
    ```text
    Usage: mobius.py summary [OPTIONS] INPUT_PDF OUTPUT_FOLDER
    
      Produce summary CSV of regional headline figures from CSV
    
    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.
    ```

Specify the input pdf file for the individual country as the `INPUT_PDF`,
and the output folder where you want the CSV to (e.g.
`./output`).

Creates a summary CSV joined to the data extracted from the SVG plots
`<OUTPUT_FOLDER>/<INPUT_PDF_BASENAME>_summary.csv`.

4. **Run the `mobius.py full` command**
    ```text
    Usage: mobius.py full [OPTIONS] INPUT_PDF INPUT_SVG OUTPUT_FOLDER
    
      Produce full CSV of trend data from PDF/SVG input
    
    Options:
      --help                 Show this message and exit.
      
    ```

Specify the input pdf/svg file for the individual country as the `INPUT_PDF`/`INPUT_SVG`,
and the output folder where you want the CSV to be saved to (e.g.
`./output`).

Creates a full CSV joined to the data extracted from the SVG plots
`<OUTPUT_FOLDER>/<INPUT_PDF_BASENAME>.csv`.
    
Command gives a short summary of any discrepancies between the summary figures
and the data extracted from svg plots.

5. **(Alternative) Run the `mobius.py proc` command**

    ```text
    Usage: mobius.py proc [OPTIONS] INPUT_LOCATION OUTPUT_FOLDER [DATES_FILE]
    
      Process a given country SVG
    
    Options:
      -f, --folder TEXT  If provided will overwrite the output folder name
      -s, --svgs         Enables saving of SVGs that get extracted
      -c, --csvs         Enables saving of CSVs that get extracted
      -p, --plots        Enables creation and saving of additional PNG plots
      --help             Show this message and exit.
    ```
Specify the input file for the individual country as the `INPUT_LOCATION` and the
output folder where you want the CSV and other files to be saved to (e.g.
`./output`).

Optionally pass in a custom the dates lookup file (e.g.
`./config/dates_lookup.csv`) - used to convert coordinates to dates.

If you want simple matplotlib PNG plots to save as well as CSV files, use the `-p` flag.

### Data format

Each CSV from `proc` will be saved to (`./output/<COUNTRY_CODE>/csv`), starting at `1.csv`. As of the **COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports** released on Friday 3rd April 2020, CSV files `1.csv` to `6.csv` relate to the country-level graphs in the original PDF (pages one and two). Then each set of 6 CSV files (e.g., `7.csv` to `12.csv`) will relate to a regional area.

Each set of 6 files follows the order:
    1. Retail & recreation
    2. Grocery & pharmacy
    3. Parks
    4. Transit stations
    5. Workplaces
    6. Residential
    

## G20 CSV Datasets

CSV datasets for G20 countries (except Russia and China) can be found at the [Data Science Campus' Google Mobility Reports Data repository](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/google-mobility-reports-data).

## Creating your own SVG

1. To create your own SVG from a PDF, we recommend using Affinity Designer. This is because Affinity Designer flattens the SVG, which is required for `mobius.py proc`. Affinity Designer also closes point features in SVG files, which other programmes do not. Use the following steps:

   1. Load in PDF document to Affinity Designer.
   1. Click Load all pages.
   1. `File > Export > SVG (for print)` if using **version 1.6.3** or `File > Export > SVG (digital - high quality)` for **version 1.8.3**
   1. Select Area: Whole Document.
   1. Save the SVG file to (`./svgs`).
   
## Utility script

To run through all available countries see `run_all.sh`.
See `run_all.sh help` for usage.

```shell
# Create summary and full CSVs for all countries returned by ./mobius.py svg
./run_all.sh
```
